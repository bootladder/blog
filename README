Build the blog locally,
jekyll build

Build the blog in Travis,
push to github

GitHub sends a webhook to ccram.org:5000/bootladder-blog

Check the deployer server on the same machine.
There's a script in there that finds the latest
github release, downloads it, unzips, copies into
a webserver root directory.



THERE IS NO MORE DOCKER IN THIS REPO.
This repo does not involve building or running a webserver.
All it does is generate the static site,
which can be deployed into a running webserver somewhere else
