<div class="jumbo-paragraph">
      I'd say I have about 5 solid years of experience in the industry.  
      My goal is to acquire more experience in the following direction:

<div class="skill-cards" >
  <div class="skill-card" >
    <h1>Testing</h1>
    <p>
      We can completely develop and test an application before the target hardware or OS even exists.  
      We can have a complete hardware test bed; especially for wireless devices!  
      We develop extra software for tests, let's develop extra hardware for tests.  
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="skill-card" >
    <h1>Continuous Integration</h1>
    <p>
      Test what you ship, ship what you test.  
      The system is entirely integrated in a cloud-based test environment without a production environment even existing.  
      You can always go back to an exact build and throw it on the hardware test bed.  
    </p>
  </div>

      <div class="skill-card" >
        <h1>Modularity and Portability</h1>
        <p>
          I've seen Conway's law in action in every engineering job I've had.  
          Let's steer it by making modular architecture critical.   
          Let's be able to swap out a PHY layer or a NWK layer, or a HAL, or an algorithm.    
          Let's be extremely flexible but not too complicated.
        </p>
