Did it before and now I forgot.  Never again!  
  
ON MY LAPTOP, On Ubuntu, install certbot
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install certbot 
```
  
Run certbot.  
Select #2, Place files in webroot directory.  






NEVERMIND, CANNOT USE LAPTOP.  
Login to the web server and install certbot.  
On Centos it is certbot-auto  
./certbot-auto certonly  
  
Select #2, Place files in webroot directory.  

Using #1 works but it needs port 80, which I was already running the webserver on, actually a reverse proxy for other running webservers.  
  
In Flask, 
fullchain.pem is cert.crt  
privkey.pem is key.key
