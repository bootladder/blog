title: Configuration Management of my Laptop
---
Similar to the contact list in my phone, my main laptop is a single point of failure.  
I take my laptop on the plane, in the car, etc.  Sometimes if I'm taking my car,
I'll take a spare laptop just in case it gets stolen.  Any time I have my main laptop,
I must have it on my person at all times, even if I'm not going to use it.  
**This is just plain stupid**.  I can get a Thinkpad T420, which is what I use exclusively now,
for less than $200.  It's relatively heavy by today's standards.  
  
* The only reason I have a primary laptop is because it's configured to my preference.
