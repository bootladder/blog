title: Configuration Management of my Laptop
---
Similar to the contact list in my phone, my main laptop is a single point of failure.  
I take my laptop on the plane, in the car, etc.  Sometimes if I'm taking my car,
I'll take a spare laptop just in case it gets stolen.  Any time I have my main laptop,
I must have it on my person at all times, even if I'm not going to use it.  
**This is just plain stupid**.  I can get a Thinkpad T420, which is what I use exclusively now,
for less than $200.  It's relatively heavy by today's standards.  Sometimes I feel tied to it
in an unpleasant way.
  
# The only reason I have a primary laptop is because it's configured to my preference.
  
I have a docking station for my T420 in my home office.  There's a lot of stuff connected to it,
so having it saves me a lot of time unplugging and plugging.  
But you know what's funny?   Docking and undocking the laptop itself is starting to take too much time.  
Realizing the laptop is not docked and I have to go get it and dock it... is not fun.  
  
# Now that I have a supply of disposable Thinkpads, the docking station is obsolete.

So, today I went out to the coffee shop, and I took a spare Thinkpad.  Not my main one.
I left my main Thinkpad on the docking station.  I got to the coffee shop, opened up the laptop,
and then it hit me.  The spare Thinkpad wasn't configured to my liking.  
* My i3wm config was default; I could barely use it
* It didn't have any of my books on it
* golang was not installed
* none of my git repos for work projects were cloned
* No SSH keys, no ~/.ssh/config, no /etc/hosts, no nothing!
* blah blah blah, you know the deal
