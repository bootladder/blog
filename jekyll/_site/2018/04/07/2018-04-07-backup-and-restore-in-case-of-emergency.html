<p>I dropped my phone and it stopped working.  After a short existential crisis, 
I went to the screen repair place the next day.  It was replaced in an hour,
fully functional.<br />
I got lucky that time.  Eventually I won’t be so lucky.<br />
<em>My contacts were not backed up.  I need to be more careful.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Grabbing .vcf’s off my phone.
First, why the hell are we using this ridiculous format?<br />
Second, why is it so confusing to access the filesystem on my Android phone?</li>
</ul>

<p>I plug my phone into my Ubuntu laptop’s USB.  Figuring out how to mount it was frustrating.<br />
But fortunately, Nautilus File Manager somehow knew how to mount it.<br />
Having no idea where it was mounted, I right clicked in Nautilus and selected “Open in a Terminal” or whatever.<br />
Then I did a <code class="highlighter-rouge">find . -name \*.vcf</code> to find the contacts.  I also exported my contacts in my “Phone App”.<br />
Shouldn’t the contacts just.. be there?  Instead of having to export them?  Yeah yeah, proprietary format.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at the .vcf files.<br />
I open one up in VIM.  Then go to the end of the file.  The person I see there, is the last person I added to my phone.<br />
I remember this.  Scrolling up, the contacts appear to be in chronological order.<br />
Scrolling back to the top, I see… totally random contacts.  Some from 10 years ago, some from 5 years ago.
Those defintely aren’t in chronological order.  Perhaps they got mixed up since I’ve changed phones a couple times?</p>

<p>Well, the reason I’m saying this is I have a problem.  I don’t know if all of my contacts are there, or just some of them.<br />
For example, there are contacts stored on my SIM card.  Are they in the .vcf file?<br />
Also, I had a couple other .vcf files on my phone, don’t remember when why or how, but they’re there.
Weirdly, the old ones are larger in size than this last one I just exported!  WHY????<br />
Oh by the way, there are no dates for when the contacts were added.  I just had to guess by the person’s name and where 
I was living when I met them, when the contact was added.</p>

<p>Whatever, it appears to be all of the contacts.  I’ll just grab all the .vcf files off the phone.<br />
Also,  the contacts were exported to the SD card, not the phone flash.<br />
<em>So, if I just make a point to export my contacts every X days, then they’ll be in the SD card which means I can grab them in the event that the phone dies for real</em></p>
