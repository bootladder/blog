  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’m trying to build my codebase in CMake or Gradle.<br />
Tried Gradle first.  At first glance there are way too many DSL keywords,
I have no idea what they do and connecting the dots is insane.<br />
It’s the same frustration I get with python.  Never knowing what type anything is
and always having to look up documentation before writing a single line.</p>

<p>Now trying CMake…</p>

<p>http://derekmolloy.ie/hello-world-introductions-to-cmake/</p>

<p>I started with this CMakeLists.txt</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
project(hello)
set(CMAKE_BINARY_DIR ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)
set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})
set(LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})
include_directories("${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}")
add_executable(hello ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main.c)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To build,</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cmake .
make
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Wow it actually tried to compile something.  No include directories were supplied.  Let’s add one.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>include_directories(myincludedir)
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Works.  Now there’s another header that’s not inside the repo.<br />
Let’s add those.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>include_directories("../samd20_cmsis_headers")
include_directories("../arm_cmsis_headers")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next error, Error: no such instruction: `cpsie i’.<br />
I must not be compling with the arm gcc compiler.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER arm-none-eabi-gcc)
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>arm-none-eabi-gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-rdynamic'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now I get this error.  Found a solution from here.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>https://github.com/digitalbitbox/mcu/blob/master/arm.cmake
# Avoid known bug in linux giving: 
#    arm-none-eabi-gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-rdynamic'
set(CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_LINK_C_FLAGS "")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For the CFLAGS I used this syntax.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-std=c99                      ")
string(APPEND CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-Wall                         ")
string(APPEND CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-Wextra                       ")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I used this to add directories containing source files to be compiled.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>file(GLOB SOURCES
    "src/*.h"
    "src/*.c"
    "src/hal/*.c"
    "src/hal/*.h"
)
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And I changed the executable to be built from those sources:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>add_executable(myname ${SOURCES})
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I noticed the output of the GNU size command shows different sizes for the
ELF output from the CMake build and the original Makefile build.
  I realized I never specified the linker script.  Let’s do that.</p>

<p>Turns out I just stick it in the CMAKE_C_FLAGS , no need for a separate linker flags.</p>

<p>Added that and I get the desired output.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename     
  3352      68    2584    6004    1774 bin/debos_firmware  
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Seeing that exact same output on either build is… extremely releiving.</p>

<h1 id="uh-now-im-trying-to-build-my-unit-test-executable">Uh, now I’m trying to build my unit test executable.</h1>

<p>I got this far …</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>file(GLOB TEST_SOURCES
    "test/*.h"
    "test/*.c"
    "test/test_runners/*.c"
    "test/test_runners/*.h"
    "mock/*.c"
    "../Unity/src/*.c"
    "src/*.c"
    "src/hal/*.c"
)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>First issue I have to deal with:<br />
Multiple Definition error from the linker.<br />
As you see, I included the test/ directory and src/.
Inside test there are some mocked objects.  The names collide with the ones from source.</p>

<p>A solution I’ve learned from various books is to compile the source into a library.
When linking the test executable, the library will only be searched when the
symbol is not found in the test objects.<br />
This hackish technique creates a priority of sorts, for names.  Test names first, production names second.</p>

<p>Now how do I do this with CMake?  Reimplement that above logic?<br />
My guess is Yes, because CMake just wraps make and it is make and gcc that are complaining
about not finding the symbols.</p>

<h1 id="create-a-static-library-of-the-application-code-and-link-it-to-the-test-exe">Create a static library of the application code and link it to the test exe</h1>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>add_library(applib_debos_firmware STATIC ${SOURCES})
add_executable(test_debos_firmware ${TEST_SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(test_debos_firmware applib_debos_firmware )
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>First, the above CMakeLists.txt is inside the test/ directory.<br />
So I have CMakeLists.txt inside both src/ and test/.<br />
To build, I go inside a directory and run cmake, and the Makefile is generated in the directory.<br />
Since the Makefile is now autogenerated, I now have it in .gitignore.</p>

<p>The ${SOURCES} is a collection of source inside src/ , but does not include HAL.<br />
HAL code is generally not compilable on host.<br />
If there is a high level HAL like a UART driver then I’ll put that in src/ not hal/.</p>

<h1 id="so-far-this-is-good--next-i-want-the-dependencies-pulled-in-automatically">So far this is good.  Next I want the dependencies pulled in automatically.</h1>

<p>This particular project needs libraries:  unit test library, 
target specific headers repositories.</p>

<p>Unit Test library is public URL, target specific headers are public git URL.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ExternalProject_Add(samd20_headers
    GIT_REPOSITORY "https://bitbucket.org/bootladder/samd20_cmsis_headers"
    BUILD_COMMAND ""
    UPDATE_COMMAND ""
    CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
    INSTALL_COMMAND ""
)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This worked to get the repo downloaded.  The following showed up in my ls:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>drwxr-xr-x 4 steve supervisorusers 4.0K Oct 10 15:50 samd20_headers-prefix/
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>What is this prefix business…  let’s put in a prefix.</p>

<p>If I put in a</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>PREFIX "hello"
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Then the repo is cloned, named hello.  what??<br />
Apparently it’s supposed to be this:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>PREFIX "samd20_headers"
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Why do I have to explicitly type the same name…</p>

<h1 id="anyway-next-problem-is-the-include-path-is-no-longer-the-same">Anyway, next problem is, the include path is no longer the same.</h1>

<p>I need to tell CMake to add include directories to the compiler command.</p>

<h1 id="oh-prefix-is-for-where-the-external-project-is-installed--doesnt-have-to-be-inside-this-project">Oh, prefix is for where the external project is installed.  Doesn’t have to be inside this project</h1>

<h1 id="moving-on-to-the-test-build-auto-downloading-the-unity-test-framework">Moving on to the test build, auto downloading the Unity test framework</h1>

<p>This one was tricky because it doesn’t provide a build script.
It is intended for the library consumer to build the source.<br />
Also, the source is not in the top directory of the repo.</p>

<p>I solved it with a kludge, don’t like it:</p>

<p>First, this is how I added compiler include directories.<br />
Using install_dir as a global variable here…</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ExternalProject_Get_Property(samd20_headers install_dir)
include_directories(${install_dir}/src/samd20_headers/)
ExternalProject_Get_Property(arm_cmsis_headers install_dir)
include_directories(${install_dir}/src/arm_cmsis_headers/)
ExternalProject_Get_Property(unity install_dir)
include_directories(${install_dir}/src/unity/src/)
include_directories(${install_dir}/src/unity/extras/fixture/src/)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Notice at the end, for unity, there are 2 calls to include_directories().
I guess it’s ok, it’s explicit and still relative to the ${install_dir}.</p>

<p>Later, in my list of source files, there’s another kludge.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>file(GLOB TEST_SOURCES
    "*.h"
    "*.c"
    "hal/*.c"
    "test_runners/*.c"
    "test_runners/*.h"
    "../../Unity/extras/fixture/src/*.c"
    "../mock/*.c"
    "../../Unity/src/*.c"
    "${install_dir}/src/unity/src/*"
    "${install_dir}/src/unity/extras/fixture/src/*"
)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>But same, I guess it’s OK, because the list is explicit and also relative to ${install_dir}.<br />
So every time this project is cloned and built it’ll work.<br />
One issue is the name install_dir is only valid when install_dir was just written to with the correct contents.</p>

<h1 id="uhhh-a-similar-issue-build-doesnt-work-first-time-works-second-time">Uhhh, a similar issue… Build doesn’t work first time, works second time?</h1>

<p>What’s happening here…</p>

<p>Same thing as before.  The Unity git repo was cloned, and then
Make is supposed to compile the source as part of the build.<br />
But Make can’t find them.<br />
In this case, Make did not include those sources in the list of source files to be compiled.<br />
Make said “Scanning dependencies of…” and then compiled the sources, but the Unity sources weren’t.<br />
All I have to do to get the build to succeed next time is:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>touch CMakeLists.txt
make
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And it works; this time, it scans the dependencies, finds the Unity sources and builds them.</p>

<h1 id="i-guess-im-not-supposed-to-try-to-do-this">I guess I’m not supposed to try to do this?</h1>

<p>Why should I build the source ?  That means I have to know how to build it.<br />
Any changes to that repo will break my build and everyone else who does it this way.</p>

<p>What’s the alternative?  They can’t precompile unless they only supported a couple targets.<br />
They could include a Makefile or CMakeLists.txt.  CMake would work I guess but not Make.</p>

<h1 id="lets-follow-this-one--httpwwwthrowtheswitchorgbuildcmake">Let’s follow this one:  http://www.throwtheswitch.org/build/cmake</h1>

<p>Since it is literally what I’m trying to do.</p>

<h1 id="eh-lets-get-ceedling-working-first">Eh, let’s get Ceedling working first.</h1>

<p>Currently I had handwritten Unity tests.<br />
Ceedling does it a bit different.<br />
Each test.c file is linked into a test app and executed.<br />
It uses its own build system so anything that was in Make or CMake before
is invalid.<br />
This means the linker and header dependencies on the production source.</p>

<p>To get the ceedling tests to work you have to put #include statements
in the tests, which makes Ceedling pull in source files.<br />
Other than that seems OK.</p>

<h1 id="problem-is-you-need-a-ruby-and-ceedling-installation">Problem is you need a ruby and ceedling installation.</h1>
