&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;gdb-commands&quot;&gt;GDB Commands&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start GDB, with an ELF file if you want.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gdb example.elf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should work on the Beaglebone native gdb, because it is ARM, difference is eabihf vs eabi&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;monitor&lt;/code&gt; actually issues OpenOCD commands thru GDB.

    &lt;p&gt;Actually the search path is the directory that OpenOCD started in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&quot;to-load-an-elf-file-into-flash-memory&quot;&gt;To load an ELF file into flash memory:&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&quot;monitor-flash-write_image-erase-fullpathtomyelf&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;monitor flash write_image erase /full/path/to/my.elf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

According to openocd manual, you should assume other flash sectors will be erased too.&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To start gdb connected to remote target:  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gdb -ex &quot;target remote localhost:3333&quot; ~/my.elf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appears to work, but not sure if it works every time.  Hence the sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">OpenOCD Pre-reqs Host: Laptop or Beaglebone, with openocd installed, with some USB programmer openocd.cfg files: repo To start OpenOCD, cd to directory with openocd.cfg, run openocd</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ubuntu WiFi Bridge to the Lab LAN</title><link href="/2018/04/15/ubuntu-wifi-bridge-to-the-lab-lan.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ubuntu WiFi Bridge to the Lab LAN" /><published>2018-04-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-04-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>/2018/04/15/ubuntu-wifi-bridge-to-the-lab-lan</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2018/04/15/ubuntu-wifi-bridge-to-the-lab-lan.html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t have Ethernet access to my gateway router; only wifi.  In my lab area I have a few Beaglebones on a switch.  I need to be able to access them from my laptops.  Ubuntu has a convenient wifi to ethernet bridge.
&lt;strong&gt;Recap: to enable the bridge&lt;/strong&gt; 
network manager applet “edit connections”, add, IPv4 settings method: shared to other computers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wish I knew how to set this up manually&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only 1 choice of subnet for the Ethernet side:  10.42.0.0 , it’s hard coded in networkmanager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK that’s the recap.  The interesting part in this post is, I just replaced the bridge laptop with a different one.  Setting up the bridge like above is simple, but now my problem is, my dev laptop can’t access the newly set up laptop.&lt;br /&gt;
Previously what I did was, configure &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; to name the bridge laptop, and also named all the hosts behind the bridge (the Beaglebones).  To make this work I used the ProxyCommand feature of ssh config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 1 obvious option is to rewrite all the entries in ssh config.&lt;br /&gt;
But another cool option would be to set up some routing.  I suppose, the bridge laptop could push routes to everybody, saying that the 10.42.0.0 network is accessible through the 10.0.1.X, the IP address of the bridge on the WiFi subnet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Woops, push routes is a OpenVPN thing.  lol!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To experiment, I added a static route on my dev laptop: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip route add 10.42.0.0/24 via 10.0.1.25 dev eth0&lt;/code&gt; , and I can ping the laptop on 10.42.0.1.  Cool!  But, if I ping a beaglebone at 10.42.0.61, I get &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Destination Port Unreachable&lt;/code&gt;.  Using tcpdump and checking the iptables on the bridge laptop, it appears that the bridge is not forwarding the ping to the Beaglebone.&lt;br /&gt;
Hmm, I don’t want to have to configure IP tables.  Let’s look at the other option, rewriting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, this is it.  Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

I take my laptop on the plane, in the car, etc.  Sometimes if I’m taking my car,
I’ll take a spare laptop just in case it gets stolen.  Any time I have my main laptop,
I must have it on my person at all times, even if I’m not going to use it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This is just plain stupid&lt;/strong&gt;.  I can get a Thinkpad T420, which is what I use exclusively now,
for less than $200.  It’s relatively heavy by today’s standards.  Sometimes I feel tied to it
in an unpleasant way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-only-reason-i-have-a-primary-laptop-is-because-its-configured-to-my-preference&quot;&gt;The only reason I have a primary laptop is because it’s configured to my preference.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a docking station for my T420 in my home office.  There’s a lot of stuff connected to it,
so having it saves me a lot of time unplugging and plugging.&lt;br /&gt;
But you know what’s funny?   Docking and undocking the laptop itself is starting to take too much time.&lt;br /&gt;
Realizing the laptop is not there on the docking station, and I have to go get it and dock it… is not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;now-that-i-have-a-supply-of-disposable-thinkpads-the-docking-station-is-obsolete&quot;&gt;Now that I have a supply of disposable Thinkpads, the docking station is obsolete.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, today I went out to the coffee shop, and I took a spare Thinkpad.  Not my main one.
I left my main Thinkpad on the docking station.  I got to the coffee shop, opened up the laptop,
and then it hit me.  The spare Thinkpad wasn’t configured to my liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My i3wm config was default; I could barely use it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It didn’t have any of my books on it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;golang was not installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;none of my git repos for work projects were cloned&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No SSH keys, no ~/.ssh/config, no /etc/hosts, no nothing!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;blah blah blah, you know the deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-do-i-do-about-this&quot;&gt;What do I do about this?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;solution-run-a-openssh-server-on-the-main-laptop&quot;&gt;Solution: Run a OpenSSH server on the main laptop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the “fleet laptop”, ssh into the main laptop to grab configuration files.
At the same time, copy them into a git repo for future convenience.
Even better, add a line in a script that copies it to the destination.&lt;br /&gt;
Worked well for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.bashrc .vimrc i3config &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;solution--ansible-playbooks&quot;&gt;Solution:  Ansible Playbooks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golang is a multi-step install, and for some reason apt-get install golang-go installs version 1.6.  Too old.&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get install ansible
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe I should just keep a ansible binary off hand, to avoid those 3 steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBD…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;etchosts-and-sshconfig--bitbucket&quot;&gt;/etc/hosts and ~/.ssh/config … Bitbucket?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitbucket gives you private repos.  Let’s just do that for now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;~/.ssh/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Copy over my ~/.ssh into the repo, take out unnecessary stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
My &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; contains:  hostnames (IP addresses or domain names), IdentityFile’s (SSH keys).&lt;br /&gt;
Should I include the keys in the repo?  If I do, it’s more convenient, but then it’s more security risk.  If I don’t, I need to generate new keys and then copy them to the hosts.  At best here I have to remember a password to access the remote machine.  At worst, the machine only authenticates with keys, no password login.&lt;br /&gt;
So again, for lack of a better solution, I’ll put my keys in the repo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Result&lt;/em&gt;:  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/&lt;/code&gt; contains key-pairs and the config file.&lt;br /&gt;
Then I attempted to login to a remote host.  Turns out, git does not preserve the 400 permission mode that the keys need to have.  So, in the install script, I change the keys to 400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Comparing my “main laptop’s” &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; with the other laptop’s default &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;, I notice 2nd line of the file:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;127.0.1.1 my-hostname&lt;/code&gt; .  This obviously is unique to the host.  But it appears that this doesn’t matter.  I should be able to remove that line.&lt;br /&gt;
OK I did that, and I notice that when /etc/hosts is touched or modified,
I get the following message: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo: unable to resolve host my-hostname&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Using this answer as a suggestion: https://askubuntu.com/a/524368 , I added the following line to my install script: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo 127.0.1.1 $(hostname) | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Similar to the contact list in my phone, my main laptop is a single point of failure.

After a short existential crisis, 
I went to the screen repair place the next day.  It was replaced in an hour,
fully functional.&lt;br /&gt;
I got lucky that time.  Eventually I won’t be so lucky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;My contacts were not backed up.  I need to be more careful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;grabbing-vcfs-off-my-phone&quot;&gt;Grabbing .vcf’s off my phone.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, why the hell are we using this ridiculous format?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second, why is it so confusing to access the filesystem on my Android phone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plug my phone into my Ubuntu laptop’s USB.  Figuring out how to mount it was frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;
But fortunately, Nautilus File Manager somehow knew how to mount it.&lt;br /&gt;
Having no idea where it was mounted, I right clicked in Nautilus and selected “Open in a Terminal” or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;
Then I did a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;find . -name \*.vcf&lt;/code&gt; to find the contacts.  I also exported my contacts in my “Phone App”.&lt;br /&gt;
Shouldn’t the contacts just.. be there?  Instead of having to export them?  Yeah yeah, proprietary format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at the .vcf files.&lt;br /&gt;
I open one up in VIM.  Then go to the end of the file.  The person I see there, is the last person I added to my phone.&lt;br /&gt;
Scrolling up, the contacts appear to be in chronological order.&lt;br /&gt;
Scrolling back to the top, I see… totally random contacts.  Some from 10 years ago, some from 5 years ago.
Those defintely aren’t in chronological order.  Perhaps they got mixed up since I’ve changed phones a couple times?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the reason I’m saying this is I have a problem.  I don’t know if all of my contacts are there, or just some of them.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, there are contacts stored on my SIM card.  Are they in the .vcf file?&lt;br /&gt;
Also, I had a couple other .vcf files on my phone, don’t remember when why or how, but they’re there.
Weirdly, the old ones are larger in size than this last one I just exported!  WHY????&lt;br /&gt;
Oh by the way, there are no dates for when the contacts were added.  I just had to guess by the person’s name and where 
I was living when I met them, when the contact was added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever, it appears to be all of the contacts.  I’ll just grab all the .vcf files off the phone.&lt;br /&gt;
Also,  the contacts were exported to the SD card, not the phone flash.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;So, if I just make a point to export my contacts every X days, then they’ll be in the SD card which means I can grab them in the event that the phone dies for real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Also I don’t want to learn stuff that will be obsolete soon.&lt;br /&gt;
That’s why I like C programming and embedded systems.  Nothing has really changed.  You learn it once and you’re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;
Somewhere in the middle of these 2 is Clean Architecture, or just modularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like React kind of throws a wrench into this.  Let me talk it out to myself.&lt;br /&gt;
JSX is not HTML.  It can be transformed into HTML, but it’s not HTML.  It would be nice if it was, so HTML could be reusable.&lt;br /&gt;
But we can ignore this and leave that hassle for the front end person.&lt;br /&gt;
I should be able to prototype my UI without any CSS, and the HTML should be throwaway code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s frustrating trying to take what I want, or what I already have, and make it work with React.  So, let’s not do that.  What if all the React code looked exactly like the examples on the web?  That solves 2 problems:  first it takes away the pain of working with the framework, second it keeps my “core logic” separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-some-of-the-essential-elements-of-react--why-am-i-even-using-it&quot;&gt;What are some of the essential elements of React.  Why am I even using it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The component class:&lt;br /&gt;
A component has state, props, lifecycle events, and a render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the state changes, the component rerenders.&lt;br /&gt;
Pieces of state can be passed to children as props.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;interesting--porting-vanilla-js-to-react-&quot;&gt;Interesting:  Porting Vanilla JS to React !!!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a vanilla JS function that creates some elements using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;document.createElement()&lt;/code&gt;, sets some to be children, populates some innerHTML, then returns the top parent.&lt;br /&gt;
How do I port this same function to React?  Well…. looks like I can’t.&lt;br /&gt;
Take a look at the vanilla version here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function createMessageListEntryFromMessageDesc(md) {

    var d = document.createElement('div')
    var playbutton = document.createElement('button')

    // Set innerHTML of Button
    playbutton.innerHTML = md.topic
    if( md.customtopic ) {
        playbutton.innerHTML = md.customtopic
    }

    // Set Color of Button
    var color
    if( md.project == &quot;1&quot; ) {
      color = &quot;blue&quot;
    }
    else {
      color = &quot;gray&quot;
    }

    // Set Opacity of Button
    var opacity
    if( md.listenedto == false )
        opacity = &quot;1&quot;
    else
        opacity = &quot;0.2&quot;

    playbutton.setAttribute(&quot;style&quot;,
      &quot;background-color: &quot;+color+&quot;;font-size : 32px; opacity:&quot;+opacity);

    d.appendChild(playbutton)
    return d
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty straight forward.  It uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;document.createElement()&lt;/code&gt; , sets properties &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; and calls method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setAttribute()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;appendChild()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now see what I did to make it work with React.  (without JSX)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function testerdom(md) {

    var text = md.topic
    if( md.customtopic ) {
        text = md.customtopic
    }
    // Set Color of Button
    var color
    if( md.project == &quot;1&quot; ) {
      color = &quot;blue&quot;
    }
    else {
      color = &quot;gray&quot;
    }

    // Set Opacity of Button
    var opacity
    if( md.listenedto == false )
        opacity = &quot;1&quot;
    else
        opacity = &quot;0.2&quot;

    var props = {
      style:{
        backgroundColor:color,
        fontSize: '32px',
        opacity:opacity
      }
    }
    var playbutton = React.createElement('button',props,text)
    var d = React.createElement('div',null,playbutton)
    return d
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, actually in terms of lines of code it isn’t horrible.  Those if statements are only setting plain old variables, so I can just factor those out.  The lame part is that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;React.createElement()&lt;/code&gt; has a totally different API from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;document.createElement()&lt;/code&gt;.  The props, not only have to be converted to object like that, but it’s super annoying that the fields changed, eg. background-color changed to backgroundColor.  Being that I want to just do the bare minimum CSS, this is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;
1 more note, to set children of a node in react, you pass them into the parent when the parent is being created.  Notice the top level node, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;, is created on the last line.  This is because React nodes are immutable.  In Plain JS, I could just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;appendChild()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conversely-what-is-lacking-from-vanilla-js&quot;&gt;Conversely, what is lacking from Vanilla JS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;no-component-classes&quot;&gt;No Component Classes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does a component class ala React do for me?&lt;br /&gt;
Lifecycle methods are cool.  With Vanilla JS, all I had was button onclick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do an experiment and mimic some of React’s behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
I want a HTML snippet like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div id=root /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&quot;my-vanilla.js&quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The javascript executes on load.  It will render my “App Component” under root.
&lt;em&gt;Phew, fortunately there are no ‘ characters in there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crap.  I can load my HTML from a file into the div, using jQuery, but, I need to ensure that the (JS that sets the button onClick handlers) is executed after the div is loaded.  Otherwise javascript says the element is null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, got out of that using the callback function on jQuery’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load&lt;/code&gt;.  After the HTML is loaded, the callback executes JS which will assign the click handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not what I intend to do, this is just a refactor/saving of my work before I write different stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
I’d like to have components ala React.  To do that, I need to dynamically generate the HTML, not just load static HTML into a #div.  Well not necessarily; actually, inside the static HTML, I could put in stub IDs in the divs, which could be set to application specific stuff, if the surrounding tag is identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize.  What I did was take all the (JS that sets the button onclick handlers) , wrap all those into a function.  That function is called in the callback of jquery load.  Another thing I did was bring the declarations of those DOM object variables to the global scope, and initialized them in the wrapper function.  This gives other functions access to those global DOM objects.  Note the DOM objects were previously global.  They became function scope when I wrapped them into a function.  So I brought out only the declarations of their names to the global scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thinking-out-loud-how-to-component-ize-my-widget&quot;&gt;Thinking out loud, how to Component-ize my widget?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My widget displays a list of messages between two people.&lt;br /&gt;
Really, the only things that need to be identified are those 2 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s list out actually what’s there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Button to load messages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Array of messages that are loaded&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Divs to hold each displayed message, one A-to-B and another B-to-A&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AJAX call, which POSTs a form with the 2 people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AJAX callback, takes the result, passes to a function that renders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rendering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rendering needs to create DOM elements that have IDs in them, and onclick handlers that can access those IDs.  For example to delete a message, the ID of the message has to be passed to a function when a button is clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-have-multiple-instances-of-the-same-thing-you-need-classes&quot;&gt;To have multiple instances of the same thing, you need classes.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;actually-wait-maybe-we-can-just-use-objects&quot;&gt;Actually wait, maybe we can just use objects?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any other language, class will give you stuff like constructors, methods that can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woah.  Maybe I ran out of RAM?  That’s a likely cause.  If not, that’s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;anyway-ill-reboot-with-the-admin-console-and-do-a-fresh-create-react-app&quot;&gt;Anyway, I’ll reboot with the admin console and do a fresh create-react-app&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-is-it-taking-so-long-i-dont-remember-it-taking-so-long&quot;&gt;Why is it taking so long… I don’t remember it taking so long&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;wow-i-didnt-realize-it-was-200mb-fresh-install--its-all-in-node_modules&quot;&gt;Wow I didn’t realize it was 200MB, fresh install.  It’s all in node_modules&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, now the dev server is up.&lt;br /&gt;
My goal is to take some built JS and put it in my existing project.&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s just get straight to that.  run a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-did-npm-run-build-do-&quot;&gt;What did npm run build do ?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;.  It took the source index.html, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public/index.html&lt;/code&gt; , removed all the comments and white space, replaced the template &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%PUBLIC_URL%&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.  Ahh here’s the cool part, at the end of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; , the following was inserted:  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/static/js/main.ee7b2412.js&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
And of course, our .js is in there.&lt;br /&gt;
Cool, let’s see if I can just pop that main.ee7b2412.js into my static site, and stick a couple HTML tags to load it up.&lt;br /&gt;
So, in the HTML I need the following: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And at the end of the body I need this: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;react-app.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;cool-that-works&quot;&gt;Cool, that works.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, can’t use this for development, because it takes way too long to build the production site.  I’ll have to go back to the development server and just start over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ok-i-need-another-refresher-this-stuff-did-not-stick-from-last-time&quot;&gt;OK I need another refresher… this stuff did not stick from last time.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything in React is JS.  No HTML *&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is a class?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A class has a constructor that takes in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; and sets initial &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A class has a method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; that returns JSX markup.  JSX is the part that’s like HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A class has life cycle methods like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentDidMount()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice tutorial here.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/@maumribeiro/a-fullstack-epic-part-i-a-rest-api-in-go-accessing-mongo-db-608b46e969cd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;main-concepts&quot;&gt;Main Concepts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically what happens is there’s a POST request, and the body contains JSON.  The JSON is unmarshalled into a golang struct.  The struct is passed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c.Repository.AddAlbum&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Repository is an empty struct with methods, eg. GetAlbums() , AddAlbum().  There are constants in the author’s code but I imagine you could put the constants eg. SERVER,DBNAME,DOCNAME in the Repository struct, so there could be 1 Repository per user.&lt;br /&gt;
The methods (eg. GetAlbums) will use the golang Mongo driver, mgo.  The database connection object has methods so we can do crazy syntax like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    c := session.DB(DBNAME).C(DOCNAME)
    results := Albums{}
    if err := c.Find(nil).All(&amp;amp;results); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(&quot;Failed to write results:&quot;, err)
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at AddAlbum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;func (r Repository) AddAlbum(album Album) bool {
    session, err := mgo.Dial(SERVER)
    defer session.Close()
    
    album.ID = bson.NewObjectId()
    session.DB(DBNAME).C(DOCNAME).Insert(album)

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
        return false
    }
    return true
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Album is passed to AddAlbum.  The ID field is generated here and set.  Then, the Album is Inserted into the database.  Cool!&lt;br /&gt;
UpdateAlbum works similarly except one line is different:&lt;br /&gt;
`    session.DB(DBNAME).C(DOCNAME).UpdateId(album.ID, album)` .  It finds the album with the ID, then replaces it.&lt;br /&gt;
I see now, basically what the database is doing is attaching an ID to each JSON object.  This is a critical missing piece, when handling JSON naively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ok-lets-install-it-on-the-server&quot;&gt;OK let’s install it on the server&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well just for fun let’s do it with a docker container.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -v ~/data:/data/db mongo&lt;/code&gt; easy.&lt;br /&gt;
Crap, 366MB image.  Another 100MB to install the client tools.  Maybe I can get away with only using the golang libraries?&lt;br /&gt;
Cool, this minimal snippet worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;func main() {
  fmt.Println(&quot;Hello1&quot;)
  session, err := mgo.Dial(&quot;localhost&quot;)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(&quot;Hello2&quot;)
    panic(err)
  }
  defer session.Close()
  fmt.Println(&quot;Hello3&quot;)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;now-the-internet-says-check-security&quot;&gt;Now, the Internet says check security&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, the MongoDB server is accessible from the public.&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s use a docker-compose.yml to put in our own .conf.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, weird, turns out the original installation had already set bindaddress to 127.0.0.1.  So… even though the Mongo server only accepts connections from 127.0.0.1, because it’s in a Docker container, it is still reachable from the outside world?  Does Docker change the source IP in the port forward?  Does that mean this same issue will happen for any server inside a container?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK my solution now is to try &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-p 127.0.0.1:27017:27017&lt;/code&gt; .  Yes!! That is the solution.  Now I am unable to access from outside.  And I am still able to access from the simple golang snippet above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hmm-weirdness-getting-a-flask-container-to-talk-to-a-mongo-container&quot;&gt;Hmm, weirdness getting a Flask container to talk to a Mongo container.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using Flask as my API server.  It is in a container.  It receives requests and then executes shell scripts.  The shell scripts are located in a host directory that is volume mounted to the container.  I compiled the exact golang dummy program above and put it in that directory.  It executes fine on the host, but when executing in the container, the Mongo server cannot be found.&lt;br /&gt;
At first I thought, there is no port forwarding that gives the Flask container access to localhost:27017 on the host.  The Flask container did have 9002:5000, which makes the Flask default port 5000 accessible by the public at port 9002.  So I tried to do a 27017:27017 in the Flask container.  But no!  Docker could not bind to 27017, because Mongo was already bound to it.&lt;br /&gt;
So, I still don’t understand this but my solution was to change the Flask container to use Host Networking, ie. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;network_mode:host&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;oh-no-that-ended-up-breaking-flask&quot;&gt;Oh no… that ended up breaking Flask!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, setting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;network_mode:host&lt;/code&gt; overrides the port forward I had &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;9002:5000&lt;/code&gt;, since the Flask server stopped responding to 9002, and started responding to 5000!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;ok-i-will-just-configure-the-flask-port--using-network_modehost&quot;&gt;OK I will just configure the Flask port.  Using network_mode:host.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh this sucks.  I couldn’t figure out how to block public access to Mongo.  So I actually put Mongo in the docker network, doing a port publish &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;22222:21017&lt;/code&gt;.  The Flask is using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;network_mode:host&lt;/code&gt;.  I did verify Flask can access Mongo, and the public cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Vidyo PaaS does not include the Media Server (Media Bridge) as part of the platform.  Vidyo does provide a Media Bridge docker image, which the application can use.  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To record or live-stream multiple Vidyo conferences simultaneously, you need to create and deploy a separate Docker container for each recording and live stream.&lt;/code&gt; .

Every recording needs to have a different config file, specifying the path and filename for the recording, plus other options.  What??&lt;/li&gt;
