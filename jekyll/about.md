Just an un-edited documentation of technical tips.  
  
My name is Steve Anderson, this is my site.

I am interested in working with you!  
  
I work onsite, travel, and remote.  I can literally jump into your project and start working.

I write application code and system code for microcontrollers, embedded linux devices, and some non-embedded stuff too.  
I write bootloaders and tools to make development and testing possible.
I keep software up to date with hardware changes.
I'm familiar with product development/engineering as well as software/hardware.
I work with designers, Mech E's, 
  
I need a mentor or some good team mates to take me to the next level.  
  
  
I'm talking about :  
  
Testing  
  
Develop, build, integrate  
  
version control  
  
really good modularity and portability
  
a complete hardware test bed, especially for wireless devices!  
we develop extra software for tests, let's develop extra hardware for tests.
