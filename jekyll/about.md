<!-- -->    
    Hello, my name is Steve Anderson, this is my site.  

<!-- -->    
    
    I am currently looking for projects.
    I am interested in working with you!  
  
  
* I work onsite, travel, and remote.  I can literally jump into your project and start working.
* I write application code and system code for microcontrollers, embedded linux devices, and some non-embedded stuff too.  
* I write bootloaders and tools to make development and testing possible.
* I keep software up to date with hardware changes.
* I'm familiar with product development/engineering as well as software/hardware.
* I work with devs, designers, Mech E's, the customer, IT, whoever.
* I will learn any language, protocol, API, platform, toolchain, CAD tool, etc.

    I'd say I have about 5 solid years of experience in the industry.  
    My goal is to acquire more experience in the following direction:  
  

  
* **Testing**  
 We can completely develop and test an application before the target hardware or OS even exists.  
 We can have a complete hardware test bed; especially for wireless devices!  
 We develop extra software for tests, let's develop extra hardware for tests.  

* **Continuous Integration**  
 Test what you ship, ship what you test.  
 The system is entirely integrated in a cloud-based test environment without a production environment even existing.  
 You can always go back to an exact build and throw it on the hardware test bed.  

  
* **Really Good Modularity and Portability**  
I've seen Conway's law in action in every engineering job I've had.  
Let's steer it by making modular architecture critical.   
Let's be able to swap out a PHY layer or a NWK layer, or a HAL, or an algorithm.    
Let's be extremely flexible but not too complicated.

  
My professional experience includes, and is absolutely not limited to: 
  
- 802.15.4 APP and NWK protocol implementations
- Protocol implementations and Userspace drivers for serial ports in Linux
- Porting firmware builds from Vendor Garbage (tm) to CMake
- Deploy firmware on remote targets, remotely. 
- Design of power electronic converters, eg. PID control, data sampling, control interface.
- Design of IoT device, eg. gateway, low-power, RF.
- Schematics,PCB Layout, BOMs, board bring up, hardware debugging, PCB rework, etc.
- Technical field work, travelling to install sites, collecting and analyzing field test data.
- Supporting Contract Manufacturers with test tools and documentation.


I've worked at Integral Software, Inc.  ODI, Inc.  JLM, Inc.  and UC Davis.  
I got a BSEE from Johns Hopkins in 2012.
