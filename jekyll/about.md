<!-- -->    
    Hello, my name is Steve Anderson, this is my site.  

<!-- -->    
    
    I am currently looking for projects.
    I am interested in working with you!  
  
  
* I work onsite, travel, and remote.  I can literally jump into your project and start working.
* I write application code and system code for microcontrollers, embedded linux devices, and some non-embedded stuff too.  
* I write bootloaders and tools to make development and testing possible.
* I keep software up to date with hardware changes.
* I'm familiar with product development/engineering as well as software/hardware.
* I work with devs, designers, Mech E's, the customer, IT, whoever.

    I need a mentor, some good teammates and a good project 
    to take me to the next level.
  
  
My goal is to acquire more experience in the following direction:  
  
* Testing  
 We can completely develop and test an application before the target hardware or OS even exists.  
 We can have a complete hardware test bed; especially for wireless devices!  
 We develop extra software for tests, let's develop extra hardware for tests.  

* Version Control , Continuous Integration  
 Test what you ship, ship what you test.  
 The system is entirely integrated in a cloud-based test environment without a production environment even existing.  You can always go back to an exact build and throw it on the hardware test bed.  Though if the hardware test bed ever changes that's a tough one.

  
* Really Good Modularity and Portability  
I've seen Conway's law in action in every engineering job I've had.  
Let's steer it by making modular architecture critical.
  

  
My professional experience includes, but is absolutely not limited to: 
  
- 802.15.4 APP and NWK protocol implementations
- Protocol implementations and Userspace drivers for ttyUSB or serial ports in Linux
- Porting firmware builds to Linux
- Deploy firmware on remote targets, remotely. 
- Design of power electronic converters, eg. PID control, data sampling, control interface.
- Design of IoT device, eg. gateway, low-power, RF.
- Schematics,PCB Layout, BOMs, board bring up, hardware debugging, PCB rework, etc.


I've worked at ODI, Inc.  JLM, Inc.  and UC Davis.  
I got a BSEE from Johns Hopkins in 2012.
